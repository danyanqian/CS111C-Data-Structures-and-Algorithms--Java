A Trio is a class representing a data structure that holds a group of three items. A Trio object has the following characteristics:

* Trios hold three items of the **same type**.
  * For example, a Trio could hold three Integers or three Strings or three Students, etc. A Trio could **not**, however, hold two Integers and a String.
* A Trio **can** contain duplicates.
* A Trio's items are **unordered**.
  * The order doesn't matter.
  * This is like a `set` in mathematics- sets are unordered. A Trio is different from a set, however, because a Trio can contain duplicates, while a set cannot.
  * For example, the Trio (3, 4, 5) is considered the same as the Trio (4, 5, 3) because they have the same elements. The Trio ("hi", "bye", "hello") is considered the same as the Trio ("hello", "hi", "bye") because they have the same elements.
